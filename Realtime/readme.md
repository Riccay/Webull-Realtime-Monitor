## Requirements

- Python 3.8 or higher

3. Configure the application:
   - The first time you run the application, it will attempt to automatically detect your Webull log folder
   - If auto-detection fails, you can manually set the log folder path in the settings

## Usage

1. Start the application by running:
   ```
   python webull_realtime_pnl.py
   ```

2. Click the "Start" button to begin monitoring
   - The application will scan for new trades in the Webull log files
   - P&L metrics will update in real-time as trades are detected
   
3. View your trading performance:
   - The top panel shows your current day's P&L
   - The metrics panel displays comprehensive trading statistics
   - The chart visualizes your P&L progression throughout the day

## Settings & Configuration

- **Log Folder**: Path to Webull log files (auto-detected or manually set)
- **Scan Interval**: How frequently to check for new trades (in seconds)
- **Auto Start**: Option to automatically start monitoring when application launches
- **Minute-Based Averaging**: Enable/disable minute-based pricing for P&L calculation
- **Dark Mode**: Toggle between light and dark interface themes
- **Custom Colors**: Customize colors for profits, losses, and UI elements
- **Time-Based Average Pricing**: Choose between standard FIFO or time-frame based average pricing (1-60 minute windows)

## Trading Journal

The integrated trading journal allows you to document your daily trading experiences:

- **Journal Entry Fields**: Main entry, mood rating (1-5), lessons learned, mistakes made, wins/successes, and overall day rating
- **Easy Access**: Click the journal button (üìù) in the header or use the Trading menu
- **Date Navigation**: Load and edit entries for any date
- **Automatic Integration**: Journal entries are linked with your trading data for comprehensive performance review

### Important: Data Storage & Backup

**All data files are stored in the `output` directory** within the application folder:
- `trade_history.pkl` - Historical trade data
- `trade_journal.pkl` - Journal entries (legacy format)
- `trading_journal.db` - Journal database (current format)
- `webull_config.ini` - Application settings

‚ö†Ô∏è **BACKUP RECOMMENDATION**: These files contain your trading history and journal entries. **Please regularly backup the entire `output` directory** to prevent data loss. Consider using cloud storage or external drives for backups.

## Project Structure

- `webull_realtime_pnl.py`: Main application module
- `webull_realtime_log_parser.py`: Handles parsing of Webull log files
- `webull_realtime_analytics.py`: P&L and trading metrics calculations
- `webull_realtime_gui.py`: Main GUI interface
- `webull_realtime_gui_components.py`: Additional GUI components
- `webull_realtime_config.py`: Configuration management
- `webull_realtime_common.py`: Common utilities and constants

## Known Limitations

- Currently only supports Windows Webull Desktop application
- Limited to day trading P&L (doesn't track overnight positions)
- P&L calculation precision depends on log file completeness

## Troubleshooting

**No trades being detected:**
- Verify the correct Webull log folder is set
- Ensure Webull is generating log files (make a test trade)
- Check if you have sufficient permissions to read the log files
- The application now performs automatic rescans every 5 minutes to catch any missed trades

**Missing trades issue (FIXED in v2.1):**
- The application now includes periodic rescanning to ensure all trades are captured
- Log files are automatically re-scanned if they're modified after initial reading
- If you still experience missing trades, try restarting the application

**Incorrect P&L values:**
- Try enabling the minute-based averaging option
- Experiment with different time-frame settings (1-60 minutes) for average pricing
- Check for position warnings that might indicate missing or unpaired trades
- Reset data and allow the application to reprocess all trades

**Data recovery:**
- If the application crashes, your data is preserved in the `output` directory
- Simply restart the application and it will reload your trade history and journal entries
